# Publishing

We use alpha versioning during development: `1.2.0-alpha.N`. Whenever you push to GitHub, increment the alpha build number (e.g. `alpha.1` -> `alpha.2`). Include the version bump in the same push.

When the user explicitly asks to publish a stable release, drop the alpha suffix and bump appropriately (patch/minor/major).
